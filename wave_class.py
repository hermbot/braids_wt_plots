# These lists come from digital_oscillator.cc. In the source code they are
# set up to be lists of either 8 or 16 waveforms, in many cases there are
# some values that are repeated to fill out the values. Curiously, table
# 16, Organ, has what might be a typo where the first value is 176
# which is out of order with the rest of the table. I removed it from this
# list. 176 was also at the beginning of digital.
